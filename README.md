# BlackCat_Hacker
Game for 2025 js13k game jam. 

BlackCat_Hacker is a mini stealth platformer where you play as Script, an aspiring hacker trying to become the best the world has ever seen. 

Only problem is... shes a cat and can only use the computer when her owner doesnt know shes there. 

Guide Script to the computer and ship as much malicous code as you can before the work day is over, (good programmers dont work unpaid overtime) or you are caught using the computer by your owner!


# How to play
Use the left and right arrow keys to move around your owners desk and the up arrow key to jump on the shelves.

When in front of the computer spam all the letter keys on you keyboard with your paws to commit as much malicious code as you can before your owner comes back to the computer!

When your owner is at the computer not only can Script not use it, but her owner will also start undoing her hard work, Luckily hes a filthy casual vibe coder and hes quite slow, however Script can use random items scattered around the desk to distract them and get back on keys, either by drinking their drink, eating their food  (by spamming the letter keys) or knocking stuff off the desk (by pushing it with the arrow keys).




# Rules of the Game

BlackCat_Hacker is split into seven rounds, each representing one work day. Your goal is to try to ship as much code each day and fill your git graph (it makes potential employers compliment your resume before they reject you).

At the end of seven days you will be ranked on your hacking ability based on how many lines of malicious code you shipped!

Your goal is to aim to ship 1000 lines of code a day or more and claim the coveted Github open source contribution hat!
